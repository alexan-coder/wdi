#GIFTY
---
##THE GOAL
- The holidays are coming!! We're going to make a Secret Santa application where the user will be able to sign up, sign in and join a group. Within this group, they will be able to create a wishlist of gifts and wait for their secret santa to pick and choose.
- The secret santa (another user within the team) will be able to look at the list and choose a gift. 
- Once a gift is chosen, the wishlist should get updated and that item should be represented differently than the others.
